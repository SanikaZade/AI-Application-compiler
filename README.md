# AI Application Compiler

> Transform application ideas into structured AI application blueprints using an automated compiler-inspired pipeline.

---

# Project Overview

The AI Application Compiler is a full-stack application that converts natural language application ideas into structured AI application blueprints. Inspired by the working of a traditional compiler, the system processes user input through multiple stages, where each stage performs a specific task before passing the result to the next.

Instead of manually designing an AI application's architecture, schemas, validations, and runtime configuration, users simply describe their idea in plain English. The compiler automatically analyzes the request, generates a complete application structure, validates the generated output, repairs any inconsistencies, and produces a deployment-ready blueprint.

The project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and software engineering principles can be combined to automate the early stages of application design.

# Features

- Converts natural language prompts into structured AI application blueprints.
- Automatically identifies application requirements and user intent.
- Generates complete application architecture.
- Creates structured schemas for every component.
- Validates generated outputs using predefined rules.
- Automatically repairs invalid or incomplete schemas.
- Performs runtime readiness checks.
- Stores execution history in a SQLite database.
- Displays evaluation metrics for every compilation.
- Modular backend for easy extension.
- Interactive React frontend.

# Compiler Modules

## Intent Extractor
Analyzes the user's prompt to understand the application's purpose and requirements.

## Architecture Planner
Designs the overall structure of the application.

## Schema Generator
Creates structured schemas describing the application.

## Validator
Checks generated schemas for completeness and correctness.

## Repair Engine
Automatically fixes detected inconsistencies.

## Runtime Checker
Verifies that the generated blueprint is ready for execution.

## Evaluation Module
Measures pipeline performance and generates evaluation metrics.

# Workflow

1. User enters an application idea.
2. Intent is extracted.
3. Architecture is generated.
4. Schemas are created.
5. Validation is performed.
6. Errors are repaired.
7. Runtime verification is completed.
8. Final blueprint and evaluation report are generated.

# Example Input

```text
Build an AI-powered resume screening platform that ranks candidates based on skills and experience.
```

# Example Output

- Application Intent
- System Architecture
- Component Schemas
- Validation Report
- Repair Report
- Runtime Report
- Performance Metrics
- Final Application Blueprint
